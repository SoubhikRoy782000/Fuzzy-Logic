# Fuzzy-Logic

Aim - 

To implement uncertain methods for real-world problem by determining the severity of  weather and to demonstrate the uncertainty in it by using fuzzy logic and an application to  plot the data using matplotlib library of python.


Algorithm -

STEP 1 – Define Non Fuzzy Inputs with Fuzzy Sets. The non-fuzzy inputs are numbers from a certain range, and find how to represent those non-fuzzy values with fuzzy sets.

STEP 2 – Locate the input, output, and state variables of the plane under consideration.

STEP 3 – Split the complete universe of discourse spanned by each variable into a number of fuzzy subsets, assigning each with a linguistic label. The subsets include all the
elements in the universe.

STEP 4 – Obtain the membership function for each fuzzy subset.

STEP 5 – Assign the fuzzy relationships between the inputs or states of fuzzy subsets on one side and output of fuzzy subsets on the other side, thereby forming the rule base.

STEP 6 – Choose appropriate scaling factors for the input and output variables for normalizing the variables between [0, 1] and [-1, I] interval.

STEP 7 – Carry out the fuzzification process.

STEP 8 – Identify the output contributed from each rule using fuzzy approximate reasoning.

STEP 9 – Combine the fuzzy outputs obtained from each rule.

STEP 10 – Finally, apply defuzzification to form a crisp output.
